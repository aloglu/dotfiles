# feh keybindings configuration
#
# Syntax: <action> <key 1> [<key 2> [<key n...>]]
#
# <key> is the key returned from xorg-xev
#
# You can specify modifier key to use along with the key:
#   C: Control key
#   S: Shift key
#   1: Mod1 key (Alt key)
#   4: Mod4 key (Super—or also called Windows—key)
#
# Each modifier is followed by a hyphen, e.g: C-S-1 means Ctrl+Shift+LMB
#
# Writing <action> without <key> will unbind the mousebinding.
#

#
# First we unbind all existing keybindings.

# rotate the image 90 degrees clockwise/counter-clockwise.
# When --edit is used, this also rotates the underlying image. Rotation is
# lossless, but may create artifacts in some image corners when used with
# JPEG images. Rotating in the reverse direction will make them go away.
# See jpegtran(2) for more about lossless JPEG rotation.
#
# Note: feh assumes that this feature is used to normalize image orientation.
# For JPEG images, it will unconditionally set the EXIF orientation tag to 1
# (“0,0 is top left”) after every rotation. See jpegexiforient(1) for
# details on how to change this flag.
